> Following the [recent announcement of Pocket's shutdown](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket) and Pocketâ€™s API will no longer be able to work, this project unfortunately needs to be shut down for good. I recommend using [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) or similar tools.

# MyPocket: Pocket but Better

## The (super-quick) story

Ah, Pocket web app. So slow, so many issues, so many things that I don't like. One rainy day, I decided to get up and built this for personal usage, designed with personal preferences.

You can use it right away on: [https://mypocket.hisam.dev](https://mypocket.hisam.dev).

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
