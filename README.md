# MyPocket: Pocket but Better

## The (super-quick) story

Ah, Pocket web app. So slow, so many issues, so many things that I don't like. One rainy day, I decided to get up and built this for personal usage, designed with personal preferences.

You can use it right away on: [https://mypocket.hisam.dev](https://mypocket.hisam.dev).

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
